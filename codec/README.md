# waSCC AWS Lambda Runtime Codec

This codec library contains a set of types and other primitives that are common to the [waSCC](https://wascc.dev/) host runtime, [AWS Lambda runtime capability provider](https://github.com/ewbankkit/aws-lambda-runtime-provider) and actor modules.

These types are serializable and de-serializable into a binary format using _[message pack](https://msgpack.org)_.
