# waSCC AWS Lambda Runtime Provider

This library is a [waSCC](https://wascc.dev/) _native capability provider_ that interacts with the AWS Lambda [runtime interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html).

It should be compiled as a native Linux (`.so`) shared object library and made available to the **waSCC** host runtime as a plugin.
